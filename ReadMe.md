# TaskTrackr

## **Project Overview**  
**Task Management System**: A platform where users can sign up, log in, and manage tasks. Users will have roles (Admin/User) and access different features based on their roles. The system will also include features like periodic cleanup of completed tasks and email reminders for pending tasks.  

---

## **Features to Implement**  

1. **Authentication**:  
   - Users can register and log in using Spring Security and JWT.
   - Secure password storage using bcrypt.

2. **Authorization**:  
   - Role-based access:  
     - Admins can view/manage all tasks.  
     - Users can view/manage only their own tasks.

3. **Queues**:  
   - Send email notifications (e.g., task reminders) using asynchronous messaging with RabbitMQ or Kafka.

4. **Cron Jobs**:  
   - Schedule cleanup of tasks marked as "completed" for over 30 days.
   - Daily reminders for pending tasks.

5. **Database Interaction**:  
   - Use JPA/Hibernate for entity mapping.
   - PostgreSQL or MySQL as the database.

6. **REST API Design**:  
   - Implement endpoints for task creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion.
   - Secure APIs with JWT.

7. **Frontend (Optional)**:  
   - You can build a simple React or Angular frontend to interact with your backend API.

## **Implementation Plan**  

### **Step 1: Project Setup**
1. Initialize a Spring Boot project with Maven/Gradle.
2. Add dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, and RabbitMQ/Kafka.

---

### **Step 2: Authentication and Authorization**
1. Set up Spring Security:  
   - Configure JWT for stateless authentication.  
   - Create login, registration, and logout APIs.
2. Define roles (`USER`, `ADMIN`).
3. Secure endpoints:  
   - Admin-only endpoints for managing all tasks.
   - User endpoints for personal tasks.

---

### **Step 3: Task Management**
1. Create `Task` entity:  
   - Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
2. Develop CRUD endpoints for tasks.
3. Restrict data access using:  
   - Admin role: Access all tasks.  
   - User role: Access only their tasks.

---

### **Step 4: Asynchronous Processing with Queues**
1. Add RabbitMQ/Kafka dependencies.  
2. Create a service to send email reminders for pending tasks.  
3. Publish a task reminder message to the queue when a task is near its deadline.  
4. Consume the queue to send emails asynchronously.

---

### **Step 5: Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)**
1. Use `@Scheduled` for cron jobs:  
   - Daily reminders for pending tasks.  
   - Weekly cleanup of completed tasks (e.g., remove those completed over 30 days ago).

---

### **Step 6: Database Setup**
1. Use PostgreSQL/MySQL.
2. Configure JPA to auto-generate tables from entities.
3. Add Liquibase/Flyway for versioned database migrations.

---

### **Step 7: Testing**
1. Use JUnit and Mockito for unit testing.  
2. Test:  
   - Authentication flows.  
   - Role-based access control.  
   - Asynchronous task processing.  
   - Cron job execution.

---

### **Step 8: Optional Enhancements**
1. Add Swagger for API documentation.  
2. Dockerize the application.  
3. Deploy on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Digital Ocean).  
4. Add Redis caching for performance optimization.
